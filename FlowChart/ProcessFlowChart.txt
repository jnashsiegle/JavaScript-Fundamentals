ProcessFlowChart

Create a flow chart that represents an instruction for something in real life.
This could be something you do on a day-to-day basis (like how to jump a car) or it could be something eventful like bungee jumping.
Criteria
* Because we use factory and recipe metaphors throughout the class, these themes/tasks should not be used. You will be graded (partially) on originality.
